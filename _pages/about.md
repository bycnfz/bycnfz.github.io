Welcome! I am currently a master student of Pattern Recognition and Intelligent System (PRIS) Lab at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), focusing on Computer Science, Machine Learning, Data Mining, Web Search, and Intelligent Network Management.
I am advised by [Prof. Bin Zhang](https://ai.bupt.edu.cn/szdw/szyl/znxxgcx/2.htm#), co-advised by [Prof. Chuang Zhang](https://teacher.bupt.edu.cn/zhangchuang/zh_CN/index.htm) and [Prof. Ming Wu](https://teacher.bupt.edu.cn/wuming/zh_CN/index.htm).

I earned my B.E. in Communication Engineering from the School of Information and Communication Engineering, BUPT.
I am now interested in Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and MultiModal Machine Learning.
And the application of artificial intelligence in the real world, especially in the fields of remote sensing and meteorology, is also fascinating to me.
My academic work has been [published](publications) or is forthcoming at conferences such as AISTATS, IEEE VCIP, and IEEE CCIS.

I will be graduated in 2024 and I am eagerly looking for Ph.D. positions. If you are interested in my works, please feel free to send me emails (zhuxun@bupt.edu.cn).
