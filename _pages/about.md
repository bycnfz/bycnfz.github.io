Welcome! I am currently a master student at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications(BUPT), focusing on deep learning, numerical analysis, and atmospheric and oceanic physics.
I'm advised by [Prof. Bin Zhang]([https://www.insc.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1157/2452.htm](https://teacher.bupt.edu.cn/zhangchuang/zh_CN/index.htm)), co-advised by [Prof. Chuang Zhang](https://teacher.bupt.edu.cn/zhangchuang/zh_CN/index.htm) and [Prof. Ming Wu](https://teacher.bupt.edu.cn/wuming/zh_CN/index.htm).
I earned my B.E. in Communication Engineering from the School of Information and Communication Engineering, BUPT.
I will be graduated in 2024 and I am eagerly looking for Ph.D. positions. If you are interested in my works, please feel free to send me emails.




My academic work has been [published](publications) or is forthcoming in
*International Studies Quarterly*, *Conflict Management and Peace Science*,
*Political Science Research and Methods*, and *PS: Political Science & Politics*,
among other outlets.
This [research](research) explores the causes and consequences of political violence using a broad variety of methods such as latent variable models, geospatial analysis, and big data. While primarily focused on civil conflict, it also examines contentious political phenomena including terrorism and economic statecraft, and develops new measures of institutions in international relations.
